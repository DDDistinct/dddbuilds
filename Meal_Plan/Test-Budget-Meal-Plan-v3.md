Meal Plan
Here is a comprehensive, budget-friendly meal plan for one week (two meals per day) based on a PHP 300 budget for two adults with a normal diet, a beginner's cooking skill level, and a focus on Filipino cuisine, keeping in mind the user's health condition (fatty liver). The plan utilizes the available ingredients: Egg, Rice, Condiments, and Bread.
Additional Ingredient Suggestions
To expand your meal options and adhere to a healthy diet for fatty liver, I recommend the following ingredients:
 * Vegetables: Cabbage (around ₱45/kg), Ampalaya (bitter melon, around ₱40/kg), Talong (eggplant, around ₱20/kg)
 * Protein: Tofu (around ₱10/pc), Sardines (canned, around ₱25/can), Chicken breast (around ₱175/kg)
 * Oils: Canola or Olive oil (small bottle, around ₱50-₱80) instead of using butter, palm, or coconut oils.
 * Flavorings: Onion (around ₱10/pc), Garlic (around ₱5/pc), Soy sauce and Vinegar (since you already have condiments, you may only need to buy if you're running low)
